Free MC Boot is a softmod for Playstation 2 consoles with version SCPH-7XXXX and lower. To install it you have to be able to boot
unofficial disc copies. A moded PS2 or a SwapMagic disc will work fine.

  - First you have to burn a disc (CD or DVD) with the uLauncher.iso image from the archive uLauncher Disc.rar. uLauncher provides you with
    a file browser and enables you to access every storage unit in the console (e.g. Memory Card, HDD, USB Drive, etc) and lanch ELF files.
    ELF files are executables for the Playstation 2.

  - Next you need a USB Flash Drive formated to FAT32 filesystem. This is the only filesystem that Playstation 2 will recognise. Then
    you need to extract to that drive the contents of the archive [161216]FMCB-1953-bin.7z

  - Attach the USB Flash Drive to the console and load the uLauncher disc with whatever way you have available for booting unofficial discs.
    I've tested this with Swap Magic v3.6 and it boots fine. When uLauncher loads go to the mass:// path and you'll be able to see the USB
    Flash Drive contents.

    NOTE: Some newer USB Flash Drives may not be recognised by the console and uLauncher will hang when accessing the mass:// path.
    You can try with an older/different drive.

    Navigate to the extracted files and execute the FMCBInstaller.elf

  - When the installation program loads first format the Memory Card. Then choose the Multi-Install option and wait for the installation
    to complete. The main difference between the Install and Multi-Install options is that Multi-Install will allow the Free MCBoot to
    load to any console you put this Memory Card, while the Install option will work only on the specific console you currently have.

  - Now press exit and when you are on the Memory Card browser shutdown the console and remove the USB Flash Drive and the uLauncher disc.
    Power the console again and you should see that the mod loaded sucessfully from the Memory Card.

OpenPS2 Loader enables you to load Playstaion 2 games from other available media. Apart from the console's optical drive you can boot backups
from USB Flash Drives, Hard Disk Drives and through your Local Network. This could help you preserve the drive's laser lifespan and allow you
to easily load up backups. You can also define virtual memory cards, activate cheats and apply graphic modes. Game compatibility while loading
from other sources is alsmost perfect, while the only issue may be a slight shuttering during FMV playbacks when using USB or Networking options.

  - This homebrew application needs the Free MC Boot hack to be installed.

  - In order to install the OpenPS2 Loader you need to have a USB Flash Drive formatted in FAT32. Then you should extract the
     OPL_1034_DB_all-01ddb89-2018-1-31.zip package to the USB Flash Drive.

  - Insert the USB Flash Drive in the console and power it on without any discs inside. Through the FreeMC Boot menu select uLaunchELF and 
    uLauncher should boot directly from the Memory Card. Navigate under the mass:// path to access the USB Flash Drive, go to the folder you extracted
    the contents of the zip file in the previous step and copy the OPNPS2LD.ELF file. Then navigate to the root menu and go to the mc0:// path in order
    to access your memory card. Create a OPL folder and paste it inside. Afterwards power down the console and remove the USB Flash Drive.

  - Power the console back on and select the Free MCBoot Configurator and navigate to "Configure OSDSYS options...". Go to "Configure Item 1" and 
    scroll to the right the using the D-PAD. On an empty item slot, select it, insert a name (OPL, OpenPS2 Loader etc.) and set the Path 1 to point 
    at the mc0://OPL/OPNPS2LD.ELF. Then go back to the Free MCBoot Configurator main menu and save CNF to MC0 and reboot your console afterwards.
    Select and run the OpenPS2 Loader from the sytem menu under the display name you gave it.

    ETHERNET MODE:

      - Next we'll setup a network configuration in order to load PS2 game backups through the network. This way you don't need to write disc images to
        USB flash drives and you can update your game library more efficiently just by handling the files on your computer. You need to share an empty folder
        on your computer with write permissions because the OpenPS2 Loader will create a file srtucture in order to manage your games. In this example we
        asume that you know how to do that and we'll give the shared folder the name "PS2SMB", although you can name it whatever you like. On the OpenPS2 Loader
        menu go to the "Network Config" and specify the Server, Folder and Credentials to use for the connection. The DHCP and NetBIOS options although
        they work fine, it may take some time to initialize the connection and give you network connections errors, so I would suggest to give your computer
        a static IP and configure your networking manually.

      - If the Playstation 2 console has sucessfully connected to your "PS2SMB" folder you should see a folder structure the OpenPS2 Loader created. So things
        are pretty straightforward now. Under the "CD" folder you put all your CD ISO images and under the "DVD" folder all your DVD ISO images. Back to the OpenPS2
        Loader main menu navigate under "Settings" and set the "ETH device start mode" to "Automatic" and the "Default Menu" to "Network Games". Navigate back to the
        main menu and select "Save Changes".

      - If you added ISO files of Playstation 2 games under the CD/DVD game folders they should be listed under the games list. If not refresh the games list.

      - If you wish to save space on your memory card you could use a virtual memory card that's stored in the network path you have to specify it explicitly on
        each game. Under each game settings you go to the VMC Slot 1 (or 2), enter a name and create it. If you wish to use the same Virtual Memory Card for
        several games you must define the same VMC name. The Virtual Memory Card file is stored in the "VMC" folder of the "PS2SMB" share.

    USB MODE:

      To be written...

  NOTE: Multi disc games that require swaping almost always provide a save option before requiring the next disc. In such cases create a save, restart the
        OpenPS2 Loader to boot the next disc and load that save that you made before the swap disc request. You should be able to continue normally.

POPStarter is a software emulator for PSX games by Sony, that was bundled with the game Bishi Bashi Stepchamp 3. It was extracted and further developed to remove
it's initial security restrictions. It allows to load PSX game through the same media types that OpenPS2 Loader offers and it can be launched through the OpenPS2
Loader. Since this is a software emulator it doesn't work with some games but its overall compatibility is pretty decent.

  - POPStarter needs the Free MC Boot hack to be installed. The following instructions also require the OpenPS2 Loader to be installed although it can be run as
    a standalone program.

    ETHERNET MODE:

        I assume that you understand your local network setup in order to add a new device and how to share a folder through your OS.
        
      - Extract the contents of POPSTARTER.zip archive to a USB Flash Drive formatted in FAT32. Find the following two files in the POSTARTER folder you extracted:
        IPCONFIG.DAT and SMBCONFIG.DAT. Open both of them in a notepad and edit them as follows:

          IPCONFIG.DAT
          ------------
          This file handles the network connection configuration. Change the following line:

            PS2-IP-ADDRESS NETMASK GATEWAY

          to what it says. An example could be:

            192.168.1.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

          You should enter appropriate IPs for your local network configuration.

          SMBCONFIG.DAT
          -------------
          This file handles the file sharing configuration. Change the following lines:

            PC-IP-ADDRESS SHARED-FOLDER-NAME
            username
            password

          to match your file sharing setup. An example could be:

            192.168.1.11 PS2SMB
            MyUser
            MyPass

          The first line is the computer's IP and share name that POPStarter will try to access. For these instructions it should be the same folder used in
          OpenPS2 Loader network setup.

      - Plug the USB Flash Drive to Playstation 2 and power on the console without any disc inside. Throught the Free MC Boot menu go to uLauncher and go to
        mass:// copy the entire POPSTARTER folder to the root of your memory card.

        NOTE: If you ever need to change your network setup configuration, update the files IPCONFIG.DAT and SMBCONFIG.DAT, and overwrite the existing ones in
              mc0://POPSTARTER.

        IMPORTANT WARNING: Both OpenPS2 Loader and POPStarter have implemented the SMB communication with the old LM (LAN Manager) protocol instead of the
                           commonly used and newer NTLM (NT LAN Manager). This could cause connection issues between the Playstation 2 console and the PC and
                           cause OpenPS2 Loader and POPStarter to fail. The best network setup I tested was a Linux server with samba and lanman authentication
                           enabled.

      - Now that the Playstation 2 console is configured we need to setup the Computer configuration. In the PS2SMB share that we also used in the OpenPS2 Loader
        setup create a folder named POPS. Inside that folder:

          * Copy the file POPS_IOX.PAK
          * Extract the files CUE2POPS_2_3.EXE and BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT from the archive CUE2POPS_2.3.7z
          * Extract the file POPSTARTER.ELF from the archive POPStarter_r13_RIP_06.zip
          * Extract the file POPStarter ELFs Batcher.bat from the archive POPStarter ELFs Batcher v3.zip

      - In order to boot PSX games the disc images must be converted them to .VCD format. To do that, the source disc image backups should be in .bin/.cue formats.
        If they are saved in any other format like .iso, mdf, ccd etc. they must be converted to .bin/.cue format.

        NOTE: If an image has multiple tracks they should all be in a single .bin file because multiple bin files for each track are not supported. Programs like
              CDmage can merge multiple tracks into a single .bin file.

        When you've got every PSX game inside the POPS folder run the BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT to batch process them and convert them to .VCD format. If you later need to
        convert a specific disc image inside the POPS folder instead of all of them you can open a terminal there and run:

          CUE2POPS_2_3.EXE <YOUR_DISC_IMAGE>.cue

      - Finally when you have your converted .VCD images inside the POPS folder you just run the POPStarter ELFs Batcher.bat file and select option 3 "Network". This
        script will read all your .VCD image files and create a fresh file list with every game available, that OpenPS2 loader can read and launch.

        NOTE: When you add/remove .VCD files to your POPS folder just run the POPStarter ELFs Batcher.bat file again to update your games setup and reflect the
              changes to OpenPS2 Loader.

      - Power on your Playstation 2 console and launch OpenPS2 Loader. Go to "Settings" and set the "Applications start mode" to "Automatic". Now under the "Apps"
        menu on the games list you should see all your PSX backups and be able to launch them from there.

  USB MODE:

      Not tested yet...

  IGR (In Game Reset):

      - To open the POPStarter IGR (In Game Reset) menu press and hold the following button combination: Select + R1 + L1

      - To update the current IGR theme your must extract the theme you prefer provided in the archive "IGR FULL.rar" to the root of your POPS folder

ESR can boot PS2 game disc backups that are spoofed as DVD video discs. This means the game's iso image must be patched first before burning it into a
disc, in order to work properly.

  - ESR requires Free MC Boot to be installed.

  - Extract the the archive ESR beta r9b.rar into a USB Flash Drive formatted in FAT32. Plug the USB to the Playstation 2 console and power
    it on.

  - From the Free MC Boot menu launch the uLauncher application. Navigate to mass:// to access your USB Flash Drive and copy the ESR beta r9b dvdv direct.elf
    file to your memory card in the following path: mc0://APPS/. Power down the console and remove the USB Flash Drive.

  - Power the console back on, select the Free MCBoot Configurator and navigate to "Configure OSDSYS options...". Go to "Configure Item 1" and scroll to an
    empty item slot. Select it, insert a name (ESR) and set the Path 1 to point at the mc0://APPS/ESR beta r9b dvdv direct.elf. Then go back to the Free MCBoot
    Configurator main menu and save CNF to MC0 and power off your console afterwards.

  - Assuming that you have an .iso image for a game you want to boot using ESR, extract the archive ESR_disc_patcher_GUI_v0.24a.rar and run the disc patcher
    ESRDiscPatcher.exe. Select a game's .iso image and patch it. Then burn the .iso to DVD-R disc using a low speed (x4, x6 etc.) to avoid reading issues
    with the console's lens.

  - Insert the disc into the console and power it on. It should give a message saying "DVD Player is not setup." at the Memory Card / Disc management screen.
    Just press back to navigate to the main menu and launch ESR. You should see different colours flashing and the backup should boot afterwards.

This application lets you boot PSX disc game backups, but it requires you to have an original game title. It's not the same as the POPStarter application because
it boots the games from the optical drive and utilizes the related PSX hardware that Playstation 2 has for backwards compatibility. Since this is not an emulator
there are no compatibility issues.

  - PSXLAUNCHER requires Free MC Boot to be installed. It also needs an original PSX game for the booting procedure.

  - Extract the file PSXLAUNCHER.ELF from the archive PSXLAUNCHER.zip, to a USB Flash Drive formatted in FAT32. Plug the USB to the Playstation 2 console and power
    it on.

  - From the Free MC Boot menu launch the uLauncher application. Navigate to mass:// to access your USB Flash Drive and copy the PSXLAUNCHER.ELF file to your memory
    card in the following path: mc0://APPS/

  - Nagivate to main menu of uLauncher and press configure. Go to R1 and map it to the path: mc0://APPS/PSXLAUNCHER.ELF and press ok

  - Power off the console and insert the original PSX game. Power it back on while pressing the R1 button on the controller until the PSXLAUNCHER screen pops up.

  - Open the tray and swap the disc with the backup copy. Press X and the backup should boot properly.
